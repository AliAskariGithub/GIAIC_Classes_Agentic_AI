# üß† Multi-Agent AI Projects - README

Welcome to a collection of three exciting AI-powered multi-agent projects built using Python. These agents simulate real-world interactions and coordination between specialized roles. Each project focuses on a different domain: career guidance, travel planning, and fantasy gaming.

## 1. üéì Career Mentor Agent

### üìå Description

This project helps students explore career paths using multiple agents that coordinate to recommend fields, skills, and jobs.

### üîß Functionalities

* **CareerAgent**: Suggests fields based on user interest.
* **SkillAgent**: Displays skill-building plans using a simulated tool `get_career_roadmap()`.
* **JobAgent**: Shows real-world job roles using mock job data.
* **CombinedAgent**: Simulates handoff between all agents for a smooth workflow.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

* `get_career_roadmap()` (Simulated)
* Dynamic agent handoffs
* üìå *OpenAI SDK / Tools*: üö´ Not yet implemented (simulated only)

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Code

```bash
uv run main.py
```

## 2. ‚úàÔ∏è AI Travel Designer Agent

### üìå Description

Plan a full travel experience based on mood or preferences by coordinating between travel-focused agents.

### üîß Functionalities

* **DestinationAgent**: Recommends places to visit.
* **BookingAgent**: Simulates booking of flights/hotels.
* **ExploreAgent**: Suggests food, activities, and attractions.
* **Tool Integration**: Uses mock versions of `get_flights()` and `suggest_hotels()`.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

* Travel Info Generator (simulated)
* Hotel Picker (simulated)
* üìå *OpenAI SDK / Tools*: üö´ Not yet implemented (simulated only)

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Code

```bash
uv run main.py
```

## 3. üïπÔ∏è Game Master Agent (Fantasy Adventure Game)

### üìå Description

An interactive text-based adventure game where multiple AI agents control the game flow.

### üîß Functionalities

* **NarratorAgent**: Drives the story.
* **MonsterAgent**: Handles combat encounters using a `roll_dice()` tool.
* **ItemAgent**: Manages inventory and rewards.
* **GameMaster**: Oversees handoff between agents and maintains state.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

* `roll_dice()` (Simulated)
* `generate_event()` (Simulated random fantasy events)
* Dynamic agent handoffs based on gameplay flow
* üìå *OpenAI SDK / Tools*: üö´ Not yet implemented (simulated only)

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Code

```bash
uv run main.py
```

## üìö Learning Outcome

* Practice using agent-based architecture.
* Understand agent handoff design and simulate real-world workflows.
* Build mock tools in Python without relying on external APIs.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: OpenAI tools and SDK integrations are simulated and not yet implemented. You are encouraged to explore those independently as an advanced extension.
